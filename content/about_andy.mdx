Hi, I’m Andy, the not-so-faceless developer behind Code by Andy!

## My Background

I’ve been working in the web development world since around 2014. I started at my university, Florida State University, where I graduated with a degree in Information Communication Technology. I have always been drawn to web development – something about the creativity, freedom, and problem solving web development allows has always drawn me in.

I have spent years working in a variety of different environments, from startups to ad agencies to corporate environments. Out of all of this, I have gained a love of working directly with clients; I enjoy building relationships as much as I enjoy web development, and working directly with clients has allowed me to engage with a variety of very cool, very talented people.

## Who I Work With

These days, I specialize in working with values-based small business clients. This includes folks like yoga teachers, therapists, social workers, nonprofits, and so much more – what all these folks have in common is a prioritization of values over profit, and an emphasis on a positive impact on the world. I am a very values-driven person – kindness, equity, diversity, accessibility, and more are my guiding principles – so I find that working with values-based clients is the perfect fit.

I became interested in working with values-based clients after meeting my partner, Riot – they are a former yoga teacher and values-based marketing consultant; I always admired their authenticity and values-driven life, and eventually made the changes needed to follow suit. I have never felt so aligned, in focus, and authentic as I do now – it’s refreshing to shed the skin of trying to adhere to certain expectations, and instead focus on being true to myself and my values.

## My Philosophy

This authenticity and alignment has led me to my current philosophy when it comes to web development – “humans over technology.” I focus on the human in every aspect of web development, including accessibility, trauma-informed design, and ease of use. I also focus on education – helping my clients understand the why is just as important to me as helping them understand the what or how. I try to build a deep trust with folks – it’s important to me to provide value, even if we don’t end up working together. That’s why this blog exists, in part.

## What's Next

If any of this resonates with you, and you’d like to chat about a potential project, you can contact me here! I offer a free, no-obligations 30 minute discussion; it’s my chance to understand your vision, passion, and values, and your chance to see if I’m the right fit for the project. Even if we don’t work together, hopefully you’ll walk away with a better idea of where to go next.

I hope this post shed some light on who I am, and why I do what I do – overall, I find that helping folks make a difference in the world is the work I love to do. Websites might not save the world, but they connect folks to resources, and generally bring folks together, which is pretty darn close in my book.


Thanks for reading,

— Andy
