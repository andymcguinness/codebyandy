As a values-based small business owner, you care deeply about your work. You do work that matters, and you focus on that work with all the care and intentionality you have.

## Your Current Digital Presence

You've DIY'd your way through a website builder, cobbled together forms and scheduling tools, and spent weeknights and weekends trying to make things "just work." It's functional, full of friction, and doesn't quite represent your values or vision.

## The Problem

Maybe you've spent 10 hours trying to make a Squarespace form do something it just can't do. Maybe you've realized your intake process involves 5 tools that don't talk to each other. Maybe you want to add a feature that would genuinely help your clients, but there's no way to do it. Maybe your website just doesn't reflect the care and intention you bring to your work.

## Never Too Small

Whatever it is, you're realizing you've outgrown the DIY phase. However, maybe you think you're "too small" for custom development, or that you have to know exactly what you want to hire a custom developer. Neither of these is true! There's no such thing as "too small" for custom development work – no matter how big or small your business is, you can benefit from having something that perfectly aligns with your vision and values. In addition, developers are excellent translators – we are skilled at teasing out what you want and need from your vision and goals!

## How a Developer Can Help

No matter where you are in your journey of having a digital presence – I can help! I can build a custom website solution that's easy to update, incredibly SEO friendly, is accessible to its core, and that is crafted specifically for your goals. If your intake process is fragmented and full of friction, I can smooth out the process by helping your tools all talk to each other, or by creating an entirely new, more intuitive flow altogether! These are just a few of the ways I can help – the only limit is your imagination.

## What's Next

If you're beginning to feel a chasm between what you want your digital tools to do, and what they actually do – let's chat! I can help you dream big, and discover what's possible when technology serves your vision, rather than constraining it.

Thanks for reading, and take care,
