If you're running a small, values-based business (like therapy, yoga, wellness, a nonprofit, or anything else driven by values first), you already know how crucial your web presence is! It's not just a digital business card; it's often the first impression of your practice, your values, and the care you bring to your work.

However, building and maintaining a website that truly represents you takes time, energy, and resources you may not have. You're busy doing meaningful work that matters! That's where this blog comes in.

## Why This Blog Exists

You know you need a strong web presence, but the path to getting there feels overwhelming. DIY website builders promise ease and simplicity, but often fall short when you need something truly custom to reflect your vision and values. On the other hand, hiring a developer sounds expensive, risky, and impersonal. In the meantime, your website sits there, outdated, inaccessible, or even nonexistent, while you focus on everything else that running a small business takes.

This blog is here as a resource for getting that truly-custom, values-driven web presence you deserve! I want to help you understand how intentional web development can benefit your business in a way that resonates with who you are and what you do.

## What You'll Find Here

**Intentional web development** — What does it _actually_ mean to build a website with intention? How can thoughtful development choices support your goals and reflect your values?

**Accessibility** — Your work is about inclusion and making space for everyone; your website should be too. I'll explore why accessibility matters and how it can benefit both your audience and your business.

**Why values matter in development** — When you hire someone to build your online presence, you're not just hiring technical skills, you're inviting someone into your vision. I'll share why I believe human-centered, values-driven development creates better outcomes.

**Practical insights** — From understanding what you actually need in a website to knowing when it's time to invest in custom development, I'll share straightforward guidance to help you make confident decisions.

## Who This Is For

This blog is for you if:
- You're running a small business that's focused on incorporating values like diversity, inclusion, accessibility, and kindness
- You recognize that your web presence matters, but you're not sure where to start
- You want something built carefully and intentionally, not just quickly and cheaply
- You value human connection and want to work with someone who sees you as a partner, not just a client

Whether you're working with a DIY site that isn't cutting it anymore, thinking about building your first website, or wondering if it's time for a redesign, this blog will help you think through your options.

## A Gentle Invitation

I'm Andy, and Code by Andy is my one-person web development practice. I'm not a faceless agency or a corporation -- I'm a real human who wants to make real connections with the people I work with. Over the past three years, I've partnered with small business owners to build websites that reflect their values, serve their audiences, and support their success.

If what I'm writing here resonates with you, I'd love to hear from you. Whether you're ready to start a project or just want to chat about what's possible, I'm here.

In the meantime, I hope this blog gives you the clarity and confidence to make decisions about your web presence that feel right for you and your business.

Thanks for being here.
